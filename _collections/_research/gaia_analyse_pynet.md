teasing: Advances in Artificial Intelligence are intended to change the world of healthcare. In neurosciences or psychiatry, the emergence of large multi-center population imaging studies paves the way for new Artificial Intelligence techniques based on artificial neural networks (also known as deep learning). We present a Python solution, based on the PyTorch open-source deep learning framework, aimed at building modern deep learning models for medical applicattions based on artificial neural networks, specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
