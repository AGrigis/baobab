Health research strategies using neuroimaging have shifted in recent years - the focus has moved from patient care only, to a combination of patient care and prevention. In the case of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, this drives the creation of increasingly numerous massive imaging studies also known as Population Imaging (PI) surveys. It should be noticed that PI studies no longer consist of image data only. The recent wide availability of high-throughput genomics has augmented the subject data with genetics, epigenetics, and functional genomics. Likewise, the standardization of personality, demographics, and deficit tests in psychiatry facilitates the acquisition of clinical/behavioral records to enrich the subject data in large population studies. Moreover, PI studies now classically encompass more than one single imaging session per subject and cover multiple-time point heterogeneous experiments. Ultimately, these studies with complex imaging and extended data (PIx) require multi-center acquisitions to build a large target population.

The NeuroSpin Anlysis Platform (NSAp) was initially designed to address NeuroSpin teams or external clients specific analysis needs, and is now able to handle the PI massive, heterogeneous and complex data from genetics, imaging, demographics, or clinical scores. The platform relies on the expertise of all NeuroSpin. The proposed services cover the distributed data collection across different institutions and countries, the data standardization, the quality control, the data analysis, and the final data sharing.

The NSAp also participates in the emergence of good practices for reproducible research.
