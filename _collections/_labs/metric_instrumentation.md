teasing: The MRI instrumentation team includes the R&D activity around multiple-transmit and -receive RF coils, but also any hardware development necessary for the monitoring and correction of the UHF-MRI parameters relevant to improve the image and its  contrast. This includes in particular the development of multi-coil shim arrays dedicated to the homogenization of the static field in the brain.
