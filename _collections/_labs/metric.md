headline: Laboratory MEthodology and insTrumentation for human and non-human pRimate ultra-hIgh field magnetiC resonance imaging
teasing: The METRIC lab aims to propose imaging methods that take full advantage of the ultra-high-field MRI potential while limiting the adverse effects that appear at such strong magnetic field intensities. This activity aims first at providing relevant tools for clinical and neuroscientific research at 7T. It also seeks to prepare the operation and valuation of human 11.7T MRI by proposing innovative technical solutions.
