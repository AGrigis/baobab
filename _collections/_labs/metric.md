headline: Laboratory MEthodology and insTrumentation for human and non-human pRimate ultra-hIgh field magnetiC resonance imaging
teasing: The METRIC team aims to propose imaging methods that take full advantage of the possibilities of ultra-high-field MRIs while limiting the adverse effects that appears at such magnetic field intensity. This activity aims first at providing relevant tools for clinical and neuroscientific research at 7T. It also seeks to prepare for the arrival and development of human 11.7T MRI by proposing innovative technical solutions.
